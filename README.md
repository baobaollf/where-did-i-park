## Intro

Hello friend!

You might have notice some smart tags located by the door on each level of our parking garage. What is it?

It is a quick tool that I craeted to help me remember where did I park my car. Now all I have to do each time I'm leaving the parking garage is to tap my phone to the smart tag and a shortcut will be triggered and automacticly: add a reminder to my Reminder app on my iPhone. Like this:

## Notes
- Only level 2-6 are suppported. Might add support to other levels in the future. 
- 2H stands for second floor higher level. And 3L stands for third floor lower level.
- I don't have any relationships with Astoria Tower what so ever, just a neighber trying to help.
- I cannot track/save/retreave any of your information. Everything is running on your iPhone only.
